Topicï¼šThis WordCount2Point_project is used for increase personal python coding skill that reach career destination

This repository contains:

1. [wordCount2point.py.py](wordCount2point.py) - For this exercise practice. Users can choose :
 type in a word that will convert your word to a Corresponding point. A is Point 1, B is point2, c is point 3, So on and so forth. Alternative, process will import 7000.xlsx file and its requirement a user offers a point, according to the offered point, process grab correspond word to display

2. [7000.xlsx](7000.xlsx) - 7000 vocabulary, From the document, obtain vocabulary and then design point formula to execute application loop until done
3. [README.md](README.md) - Explain how this repository's file propose used for and how to usage

This wordCount2point is used for increase personal coding skill that reach career destination

I will continue looking for something interesting project or little idea to practice

The wordCount2point.py goals for this repository are:

-  type in a word that will convert your word to a Corresponding point. A is Point 1, B is point2, c is point 3, So on and so forth. Alternative, process will import 7000.xlsx file and its requirement a user offers a point, according to the offered point, process grab correspond word to display

## Functions

- Func 1. type in a word that will convert your word to a Corresponding point. A is Point 1, B is point2, c is point 3, So on and so forth.

- Func 2. process will import 7000.xlsx file and its requirement a user offers a point, according to the offered point, process grab correspond word to display

## Requirements.txt

Used module for wordCount2point:
```sh
Regular expression >= latest
Openpyxl >= latest
```

## QuickStart

```sh

1. Create a Python Virtual Environment

2. git clone https://github.com/asd01248967/WordCount2Point_project.git

3. cd WordCount2Point_project

4. pip install Requirements.txt

5. python wordCount2point.py

6. choosen one you wanna to execute: Func1 or Func2 

7-1. choosen Func1.Enter a word and check the word to convert the qualified word into a point and display it
7-2. choosen Func2.Import 7000 words, input the specified point, convert 7000 words into conforming points, check whether they meet the specified point, and display it
7-3. if norther Func1, Func2 nor numeric will show execption error and pop up prompt, must ensure your input is correct

8-1. choosen 7-1. ask you provoid a word and take it to count what point you get
8-2. choosen 7-2. ask you provoid a requirements point and filter correspond word to you
8-3. if norther Func1, Func2 nor numeric will show execption error and pop up prompt, must ensure your input is correct
```
