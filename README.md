## Background

Attitude Is Everything

This Exercise is used for increase personal coding skill that reach career destination

The goals for this repository are:

Used module:
1. Regular expression
2. Openpyxl

> Suppose A is one point, and B is two point,
so on and so forth respectively representative itself point.then how many vocabulary exactly same as Attitude with one hundred points as well 

## Install

This project uses [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
reference：https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/

1. Download get-pip.py to a folder on your computer.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder containing get-pip.py.
3. Run the following command:
   python get-pip.py
5. Pip is now installed!
```
## Usage

This is only a conter how many vocabulary same as Attitude  as one hundred point ,and than you need download 7000.xlsx file to read by file1.py .than You need install moudle  Regular expression and Openpyxl to computing process.

```sh
$pip install openpyxl
$pip install re
--------------------------
how to execute
$ python file1.py
# Prints out the vocabulary in list 
Result：
{'carpenter', 'Wednesday', 'delivery', 'pursue', 'whiskey', 'inflation', 'thirty', 'fountain', 'excellent', 'discipline', 'companion', 'socialism', 'elsewhere', 'eventual', 'hospital', 'corridor', 'personal', 'intellect', 'repress', 'clockwise', 'stress', 'boundary', 'chimpanzee', 'drizzle', 'printer', 'irritate', 'adulthood', 'producer', 'prevent', 'accumulate', 'status', 'restore', 'towards', 'culture', 'whenever', 'session', 'congress', 'boycott', 'outset', 'quarter', 'boulevard', 'analysis', 'telescope', 'selective', 'utensil', 'pumpkin', 'lightning', 'attitude', 'wholesale', 'likelihood', 'variety', 'researcher', 'acknowledge', 'turkey', 'therefore', 'ornament', 'interfere', 'telephone', 'primary'}
