## Background

> Attitude Is Everything, keep goin, keep moving, fall forward

This wordCount2point is used for increase personal coding skill that reach career destination

I will continue looking for something interesting project or little idea to practice

The wordCount2point.py goals for this repository are:

>  type in a word that will convert your word to a Corresponding point. A is Point 1, B is point2, c is point 3, So on and so forth. Alternative, process will import 7000.xlsx file and its requirement a user offers a point, according to the offered point, process grab correspond word to display

## Functions

print all of these meet 100 point count in the 7000 vocabular xlsx file
